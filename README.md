Git will be helpful in adding files using the git add function.
It will be nice to manage repositioires using the git branches. 
The git feature that allows for multiple files to be added at once will be helpful
when dealing with files that are the same like text files git add '*.txt'
Git also gives the ability to look at changes that have been made using the git diff Head function
These are just a few of the nice fuctions git provides
